Hi! I am from Delhi. My hobbies include dancing, reading novels, sketching and binge watching movies.

I want to contribute to open source becuase it is a cool way to help others and through open source i can get help in my own projects from people all over the world. they can present their ideas and collabrate to anything i build, and i can contribute my ideas to their project. it would also help me improve my skills and learn from others! it is also very fun to do and learn!
